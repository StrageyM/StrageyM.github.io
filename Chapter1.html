<h1>Chapter 1.</h1>
<p> The section that jumped out to me was the The Cat Ate My Source Code. This section explained that taking responsibility and not making lame excuses when you fall short, is very important for a  Pragmatic Programmer as well as working on a team efficiently. When we make mistakes we tend to try and offset the mistake to a third party. This is defined as “scapegoating”. This happens all time and not just in the world of software development. Taking responsibility of the outcome of one’s actions is never an easy thing to do. But when we do, you are seen as someone who can be held accountable for their actions. </p>
<p> I really relate to this section. In my personal life I have been trying to offset my problems and my mistakes to whichever scapegoat is readily available. This will be my challenge for the semester. It is time that I starting accepting responsibility for all my actions, and for my word. If I say something I need to do it and if I make a mistake I need to own up to it. These past few semesters I have been dealing with some hard family and life events. But they are in the past, and I no longer need to let them affect my performance in school or my social life that resides outside of it. I need to take responsibility for my own life and my own goals.</p>
