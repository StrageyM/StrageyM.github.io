<h1>Chapter 1.</h1>
<p>The section that jumped out to me was the The Cat Ate My Source Code. This section explained that taking responsibility and not making lame excuses when you fall short, is very important for a  Pragmatic Programmer as well as working on a team efficiently. When we make mistakes we tend to try and offset the mistake to a third party. This is defined as “scapegoating”. This happens all time and not just in the world of software development. Taking responsibility of the outcome of one’s actions is never an easy thing to do. But when we do, you are seen as someone who can be held accountable for their actions.
