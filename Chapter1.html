<h1>Chapter 1 Blog.</h1>
<p> The section that jumped out to me was the The Cat Ate My Source Code. This section explained that taking responsibility and not making lame excuses when you fall short, is very important for a  Pragmatic Programmer as well as working on a team efficiently. When we make mistakes we tend to try and offset the mistake to a third party. This is defined as “scapegoating”. This happens all time and not just in the world of software development. Taking responsibility of the outcome of one’s actions is never an easy thing to do. But when we do, you are seen as someone who can be held accountable for their actions. </p>
<p> I really relate to this section. In my personal life I have been trying to offset my problems and my mistakes to whichever scapegoat is readily available. This will be my challenge for the semester. It is time that I starting accepting responsibility for all my actions, and for my word. If I say something I need to do it and if I make a mistake I need to own up to it. These past few semesters I have been dealing with some hard family and life events. But they are in the past, and I no longer need to let them affect my performance in school or my social life that resides outside of it. I need to take responsibility for my own life and my own goals.</p>
<p> Now to switch things up, not making excuses goes both ways. Being able to be held accountable is very important for working on a team. But I think it is also time to keep those in charge responsible for their actions and for their team. Managers and Dev leads have a duty to their team members to celebrate achievements and not just punish for failures. Yes it is very important to correct and make sure that each team member is doing their job. But accomplishments need to be rewarded. As a leader, they have the responsibility to reward their staff and show them that their work has value and is essential to the bigger picture. Often times the people in power use scapegoating to get out of rewarding and use it to flip the tables and show that no matter how important the work you have performed is, it has not gotten you anywhere or anything. Take responsibility for your accomplishments just as much as you do for your mistakes. </p>
